  - **Details:** Some features that other bundlers integrate out of the box require additional configuration in Rollup.

## Decision

We have chosen to use **Vite** as our bundler for the application.

## Rationale

1.  **Development Speed**: Vite provides an exceptionally fast development server with Hot Module Replacement (HMR), allowing instant feedback during development. This significantly enhances developer productivity by reducing waiting times for builds and reloads.

2.  **Simplicity and Ease of Use**: Vite is designed to be simple to configure, accommodating both beginners and experienced developers. This low barrier to entry enables our team to focus more on building features rather than wrestling with complex configuration files.

3.  **Native ES Module Support**: Vite leverages native ES modules, enabling uninterrupted development without needing extensive bundling during development. Newer features can be utilized immediately, providing a modern development experience.

4.  **Modern Tooling**: Vite comes with out-of-the-box support for TypeScript, JSX, CSS preprocessors, and various modern web technologies. This integration reduces the need for additional configuration while allowing us to take advantage of current best practices.

5.  **Performance Benefits**: With its architecture designed for modern web development, Vite offers quicker builds, especially for large applications, which is a significant improvement over traditional bundlers that can become sluggish as complexity increases.

6.  **Monorepo Compatibility**: Vite is particularly well-suited for monorepo architecture, allowing us to manage multiple packages efficiently. It supports local development across packages without the need for additional configuration, streamlining our workflow and making it easier to share dependencies between different parts of the application.

## Consequences

1.  **Learning Curve for Team**: While Vite is simpler than others, developers transitioning from Webpack might need time to adapt to its conventions and features.

2.  **Ecosystem Maturity**: As a newer bundler, Vite may have fewer plugins and integrations available than established options like Webpack. However, the community is rapidly growing, and many common use cases are already supported.

3.  **Limited Customization**: Although Viteâ€™s simplicity is an advantage, teams with very specific bundling needs may find Vite less configurable compared to Webpack or Rollup.

4.  **Initial Adoption Challenges**: Transitioning to Vite may require an initial investment in time to train the team and establish best practices in the new setup.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, we have decided to adopt **Vite** as our bundler due to its exceptional speed, simplicity, and native support for modern web standards. The ability to efficiently manage a monorepo architecture further solidifies this choice, aligning perfectly with our project's requirements for scalability and modularity. While more established options like Webpack offer extensive configurability and ecosystem maturity, the development efficiency gains and straightforward setup provided by Vite position our team to focus on building features and improving the application. We believe this decision will enhance our workflow, facilitate collaboration, and enable smoother development experiences as we progress through the project.
