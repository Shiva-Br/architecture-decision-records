# Choosing TypeScript over JavaScript

## Context

As we embark on developing our application, selecting the right programming language for our codebase is critical. This decision will impact our development speed, maintainability, scalability, and overall code quality. Given our team's expertise and the nature of the project, we must decide whether to use JavaScript or TypeScript as our primary language.

## Options Considered

### 1. JavaScript

**Pros:**

Familiarity with the language for most developers.
No additional compilation steps.
Extensive ecosystem and community support.

**Cons:**

Lack of static type checking can lead to runtime errors.
Limited tooling capabilities for large codebases.
Less support for modern language features without transpilation.

### 2. TypeScript

**Pros:**

Static type checking helps catch errors during development, reducing runtime errors.
Improved tooling support (e.g., autocompletion, refactoring).
Better support for large codebases; improves maintainability and collaboration.
Modern language features and cleaner syntax (enables ES6+ features).

## Decision

We have chosen to use TypeScript as our primary programming language over JavaScript.

## Rationale

Static Type Checking: TypeScript’s static type system helps identify and handle errors early in the development process, resulting in fewer runtime errors. This is especially beneficial for large codebases, where tracking down errors can be cumbersome.

**Enhanced Tooling**: TypeScript provides better tooling capabilities, including advanced autocompletion, inline documentation, and refactoring tools. These features can significantly increase developer productivity and reduce the time spent on debugging.

**Improved Maintainability**: The clear type definitions and interfaces in TypeScript enhance the readability and understandability of our codebase. This leads to better collaboration among team members and makes onboarding new developers easier.

**Modern Features**: TypeScript supports modern JavaScript features, including async/await, decorators, and more, allowing us to write cleaner and more efficient code without concerns about backward compatibility issues.

**Growing Adoption**: TypeScript’s popularity is rapidly increasing in the developer community, particularly for building large-scale applications. This trend suggests a solid future-proofing strategy as more libraries and frameworks start to support or heavily adopt TypeScript.

## Consequences

**Learning Curve**: Developers who are unfamiliar with TypeScript may face an initial learning curve, which could lead to slower onboarding and development speed initially.

**Compilation Step**: The need to compile TypeScript into JavaScript introduces an additional build step, which may add slight complexity to the development workflow, especially when setting up the build system.

**Tooling Overhead**: While TypeScript provides superior tooling, it may require configuring development environments to handle typings and ensure a smooth workflow, which can take time.

**Potential Overhead**: Type annotations and type definitions may introduce additional code complexity; therefore, it’s important to find a balance between type safety and simplicity.

## Conclusion

After careful consideration of the benefits and drawbacks, we have decided to adopt TypeScript as our main programming language for this project. The advantages of static type checking, improved tooling, greater maintainability, and support for modern features outweigh the initial learning curve and additional setup. We believe that using TypeScript will lead to a more robust, maintainable, and scalable application over time.
