## Decision

We have chosen to use **pnpm** as our package manager for the project.

## Benchmark

The following table summarizes the performance of different package managers based on three key operations: installing packages, cleaning the cache, and cleaning the cache after the initial clean. The benchmarks were conducted to compare the efficiency of `pnpm`, `Yarn`, and `npm`.

| Dependency Manager | Install Packages | Clean Cache | Clean Cache (after initial) |
| ------------------ | ---------------- | ----------- | --------------------------- |
| **pnpm**           | 11.7s            | 2.4s        | 4.7s                        |
| **Yarn v1**        | 59.1s            | 4.7s        | 15.4s                       |
| **Yarn v3**        | 77.7s            | 0.27s       | 14.4s                       |
| **npm**            | 46.2s            | 0.85s       | 15.1s                       |

### Description

- **Install Packages:** Measures the time taken to install all specified packages.

  - **pnpm** is the fastest with 11.7 seconds, indicating superior performance in package installation.
  - **npm** takes 46.2 seconds, showing moderate performance.
  - **Yarn v1** and **Yarn v3** have longer installation times, at 59.1 seconds and 77.7 seconds, respectively.

- **Clean Cache:** Measures the time required to clean the package manager's cache.

  - **Yarn v3** is the fastest with a significantly short time of 0.27 seconds.
  - **npm** and **pnpm** have intermediate times of 0.85 seconds and 2.4 seconds, respectively.
  - **Yarn v1** takes the longest at 4.7 seconds.

- **Clean Cache (after initial):** Measures the time to clean the cache after the initial cleaning.
  - **pnpm** is the fastest at 4.7 seconds, reflecting its efficient cache management.
  - **Yarn v1** has the longest time at 15.4 seconds.
  - **Yarn v3** and **npm** have intermediate times of 14.4 seconds and 15.1 seconds, respectively.

In summary, `pnpm` demonstrates superior performance in installing packages and managing cache, especially when compared to `Yarn` and `npm`. `Yarn v3` excels in initial cache cleaning but has slower package installation and cache management times. `npm` shows consistent performance across operations but lags behind `pnpm` in package installation speed.

## Rationale

- **Performance Efficiency**

- **Benefit:** pnpm outperforms both npm and Yarn.

- **Details:** Installs dependencies from a global store without duplication, saving time and disk space.

- **Benefit:** Reduces disk space consumption.

- **Details:** Uses hard links and central package storage, advantageous for multiple projects.

- **Consistent Dependency Management**

- **Benefit:** Enforces strict versioning and resolution.

- **Details:** Minimizes risk of conflicts, leading to a stable development environment.

- **Monorepo Friendly**

- **Benefit:** Ideal for monorepo architecture.

- **Details:** Native workspace support enhances efficiency in managing multiple packages.

- **Active Development**

- **Benefit:** Regular updates and feature improvements.

- **Details:** Growing community adoption indicates positive support and tooling prospects.

## Consequences

- **Learning Curve**

- **Issue:** Transition from npm or Yarn.

- **Details:** May require additional resources and documentation to ease the learning curve.

- **Migration Efforts**

- **Issue:** Adapting existing projects.

- **Details:** Migration involves updating scripts and processes from npm or Yarn.

- **Potential Compatibility Issues**

- **Issue:** Some plugins or integrations.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, we have decided to adopt **pnpm** as our package manager for the project. Its advantages in terms of performance, disk space optimization, and consistent dependency management align perfectly with our project's needs. Additionally, pnpm’s workspace feature complements our strategy of using a monorepo architecture. Despite potential challenges related to community size and migration, these are outweighed by the long-term benefits that pnpm offers. This decision positions our development team for greater efficiency and stability as we build and scale our application.
