# Choosing Monorepo Architecture

## Context

As we begin to structure our application and its associated libraries, we need to choose the best architectural pattern for managing our codebase. With various options available, including polyrepo (multiple repositories) and monorepo (single repository), it is essential to assess which approach will best serve our current needs and future scalability. Our decision will impact collaboration, dependency management, build processes, and overall project organization.

## Considered Options

### 1. Monorepo

**Pros:**

#### Code Reusability

- **Benefit:** Monorepos encourage code reusability by allowing multiple projects to share common code.
- **Details:** This reduces duplication and ensures consistency.
- **Additional Point:** Easier to share code across projects, promoting code reuse.

#### Collaboration

- **Benefit:** Easier Collaboration.
- **Details:** With all code in one place, collaboration becomes seamless. Developers can access and modify different projects without having to switch repositories.
- **Additional Point:** Streamlined development experience across teams and components. Also shared modules and components can be reused across projects without complex integration methods.

#### Dependency Management

- **Benefit:** Streamlined Dependency Management.
- **Details:** Managing dependencies is simplified, as all projects share a single package manager and version control system.
- **Additional Point:** Centralized codebase simplifies dependency management and versioning.

#### Commits and Releases

- **Benefit:** Atomic Commits and Releases.
- **Details:** Monorepos enable atomic commits and releases, ensuring that changes across multiple projects are always in sync.

#### Testing

- **Benefit:** Improved Testing.
- **Details:** Comprehensive testing becomes easier, as you can run tests across all projects simultaneously, ensuring better code quality.
- **Additional Point:** Simplifies integration testing of interdependent packages.

#### Tooling and Configuration

- **Benefit:** Facilitates consistent tooling, configurations, and standards.

**Cons:**

#### Complexity

- **Issue:** Monorepos can become complex as the codebase grows.
- **Details:** This makes it challenging to navigate and understand.
- **Additional Point:** Increased complexity in managing permissions when multiple teams access the same repository.

#### Slower Cloning

- **Issue:** Initial repository cloning can be time-consuming.
- **Details:** This can be particularly problematic for new developers joining the team.
- **Additional Point:** Potential for larger repository size, which might lead to slower

### 2. Polyrepo (Multiple Repositories)

**Pros:**

### Permissions and Access Control

- **Benefit:** Isolated repositories can simplify permissions and access control.

- **Details:** Each team can have precise control over who can access and modify their codebase.

### Repository Size

- **Benefit:** Reduced repository size can lead to faster clone times.

- **Details:** Smaller repositories are easier and quicker to clone, which is beneficial for new developers and CI/CD processes.

### Team Autonomy

- **Benefit:** Team autonomy over their respective codebases can lead to faster development cycles.

- **Details:** Teams can work independently without being affected by changes in other projects.

**Cons:**

#### Dependency Management

- **Issue:** Increased complexity in dependency management, especially when multiple projects share common libraries.

- **Details:** Ensuring that all projects are using the correct versions of shared libraries can be challenging.

#### Consistency

- **Issue:** Harder to maintain consistency across different codebases.

- **Details:** This can lead to fragmented tooling and standards.

- **Additional Point:** Code duplication may occur if shared libraries are not managed appropriately.

## Decision

We have chosen to implement a **monorepo architecture** for our project.

## Rationale

1.  **Unified Codebase**: A monorepo allows us to store all related projects, libraries, and services in a single repository. This unification simplifies dependency management and enables straightforward versioning, making it easier to collaborate across teams and projects.

2.  **Code Reusability and Sharing**: With common libraries and components stored in the same repository, teams can easily share code without worrying about version mismatches or complicated dependency management. This promotes a DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) code philosophy, reducing redundancy and maintenance overhead.

3.  **Consistent Development Practices**: A single repository allows us to enforce consistent coding standards, tooling, and development workflows across all teams and projects. This leads to a cohesive development experience and helps maintain high code quality.

4.  **Easier Refactoring**: Refactoring becomes more manageable in a monorepo setup. Since all code is centralized, making changes across multiple packages or components can be done atomically, reducing the chances of introducing bugs and improving maintainability.

5.  **Improved CI/CD Processes**: CI/CD pipelines can be designed to handle monorepo structures more efficiently. We can set up workflows that build and test only the affected packages, leading to faster pipelines and reducing overhead.

## Consequences

Adopting a monorepo approach will require changes in how we manage our codebase, including:

1.  **Repository Size**: As the project and its dependencies grow, the repository size may increase, potentially leading to slower clone times. We will need to implement strategies to mitigate this, such as optimizing our git and CI/CD tooling.

2.  **Team Coordination**: With multiple teams working in the same repository, it will be essential to establish clear communication and workflows to avoid conflicts and coordinate changes effectively.

3.  **Cross-Team Collaboration**: A monorepo can enhance collaboration among teams by facilitating shared knowledge and practices, but it may also require more organizational discipline to manage interdependencies and review processes.

4.  **Tooling and Infrastructure**: Transitioning to a monorepo will require updates to our CI/CD pipelines and possibly the introduction of new tools to manage the repository effectively. This includes ensuring build efficiency, managing dependencies, and handling large-scale version control.

5.  **Training and Onboarding**: Team members will need to be trained on the new workflow and tools associated with a monorepo. This includes understanding the structure, best practices for making changes, and how to utilize shared resources effectively.

6.  **Scalability**: As the repository grows, we will need to continually assess and address scalability concerns. This includes monitoring performance, optimizing workflows, and ensuring that our infrastructure can handle the increased load.

These changes are expected to result in improved efficiency, better collaboration, and higher code quality across all projects.

## Conclusion

In summary, we have decided to adopt a **monorepo architecture** for our project. The benefits of unified code management, easier code sharing, consistent practices, and simplified integration testing align well with our team's goals for collaboration and scalability. While there are challenges associated with managing a larger repository and coordinating team efforts, the advantages offered by a monorepo approach will enable us to build a more resilient, maintainable, and efficient application. This architectural decision sets a solid foundation as we scale our project and team in the future.
