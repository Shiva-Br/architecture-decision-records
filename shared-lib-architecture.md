# Introducing a Shared UI Library in the Monorepo

## Context

As our project continues to grow and evolve within a monorepo architecture, we recognize the need for a unified approach to developing and maintaining UI components across different applications and services. A shared UI library will provide a consistent look and feel and promote reusability of common components, thereby enhancing our development efficiency and user experience.

## Options Considered

### 1. Create a Shared UI Library

**Pros:**

- **Promotes Code Reuse**

  - **Benefit:** Reduces duplication.
  - **Details:** Encourages the reuse of components across multiple applications or projects. This reduces redundancy, saves development time, and ensures that the same components are used consistently throughout different parts of the application.

- **Ensures Consistency in Design and User Experience**

  - **Benefit:** Uniformity across the project.
  - **Details:** Provides a consistent design language and user experience by standardizing UI elements and interactions. This consistency enhances usability and helps maintain a cohesive look and feel across the entire project.

- **Streamlines the Development Process**

  - **Benefit:** Accelerates development with pre-built components.
  - **Details:** Offers a library of pre-built components that developers can leverage to speed up the development process. By using these components, teams can focus on implementing application-specific features rather than building UI elements from scratch.

- **Facilitates Centralized Maintenance and Updates**
  - **Benefit:** Simplifies UI component management.
  - **Details:** Centralizes the maintenance and updating of UI components, making it easier to implement changes or improvements. This approach ensures that updates are applied uniformly across all instances of the components, reducing the risk of inconsistencies.

**Cons:**

- **Initial Setup Effort**

  - **Issue:** Setup and design standardization.
  - **Details:** Significant initial effort is required to set up the component library and establish design standards. This includes defining the design system, creating or integrating components, and ensuring that all team members are aligned with the new standards.

- **Potential Bottleneck**

  - **Issue:** Risk of becoming a bottleneck.
  - **Details:** If not managed effectively, the component library can become a bottleneck, particularly in projects with multiple teams. Coordination is needed to ensure that updates and changes are communicated and applied consistently, which can slow down development if not handled well.

- **Versioning and Documentation Maintenance**
  - **Issue:** Ongoing maintenance requirements.
  - **Details:** Requires continuous maintenance of versioning and documentation for the shared components. Keeping the library up to date and well-documented is essential for ensuring that all teams use the components correctly and understand any changes or updates.

### 2. Utilize Existing UI Frameworks (e.g., React Aria)

**Pros:**

- **Leverages Established Design Systems**

  - **Benefit:** Access to robust resources.
  - **Details:** Utilizes well-established design systems that come with comprehensive documentation and strong community support. This provides a solid foundation and reduces the time required to develop and maintain design guidelines.

- **Saves Time on Development and Design**

  - **Benefit:** Faster implementation.
  - **Details:** Pre-designed components are readily available, allowing for quicker development and design processes. This reduces the need to create and style components from scratch, speeding up project delivery.

- **Reduces Maintenance Effort**
  - **Benefit:** Less upkeep required.
  - **Details:** Minimizes the need to maintain custom components. The third-party library handles updates and bug fixes, freeing up time for developers to focus on other aspects of the project.

**Cons:**

- **Potential Misalignment with Branding**

  - **Issue:** Design consistency.
  - **Details:** The library may not perfectly align with specific branding and design guidelines. Customization might be required to match the brand’s look and feel, which can be time-consuming.

- **Increased Bundle Size**

  - **Issue:** Larger file sizes.
  - **Details:** Including an entire framework can lead to a larger bundle size, even if only a few components are used. This can impact application performance and loading times.

- **Limited Customization Options**
  - **Issue:** Flexibility constraints.
  - **Details:** The library may offer limited customization options compared to a custom-built solution. Adapting the library for specific use cases might be challenging, requiring workarounds or compromises.

## Decision

We have decided to implement a **shared UI library** within our monorepo.

## Rationale

1.  **Code Reusability**: A shared UI library enables us to reuse components across multiple applications. This reduces development time as teams can leverage existing components rather than building new ones from scratch.

2.  **Consistency in User Experience**: By using a shared library, we can ensure that all applications adhere to the same design principles and guidelines, delivering a cohesive user experience across the entire project.

3.  **Centralized Maintenance**: A centralized library allows for easier updates and maintenance of UI components. When a change is made, it automatically benefits all applications that use the shared library, ensuring consistency and reducing the chances of discrepancies.

4.  **Faster Development Cycle**: Developers can focus on building features rather than worrying about creating and maintaining shared components, leading to faster iteration cycles and quicker time-to-market for new features.

5.  **Design System Alignment**: We can create a design system that reflects our branding and user environment by developing a custom shared library. This level of customization ensures that our UI aligns with our company’s identity and user satisfaction.

## Consequences

1.  **Initial Setup Time**: Developing a shared UI library requires an upfront investment in time and resources to define components, set up the development environment, and ensure alignment with design standards.

2.  **Versioning and Documentation**: We will need to establish robust versioning practices and maintain thorough documentation for the shared UI library to facilitate ease of use for all teams.

3.  **Collaboration Across Teams**: Effective collaboration will be essential as multiple teams contribute to the shared library. We will need to establish clear governance, guidelines, and processes to manage contributions and resolve conflicts.

4.  **Potential Bottleneck**: With multiple teams relying on the shared library, we must be vigilant about avoiding bottlenecks in development. This requires proactive communication and streamlined processes for updating and adding components.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, we have decided to introduce a **shared UI library** within our monorepo architecture. This decision supports our goals for code reuse, consistency across applications, and efficient development practices. While there will be challenges in establishing the library and fostering collaboration among teams, the long-term benefits of a unified approach to UI development will greatly enhance our project's success. By investing in this shared resource, we position our applications for a cohesive user experience and improve our overall development efficiency.
